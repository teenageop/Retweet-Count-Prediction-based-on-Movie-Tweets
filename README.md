We collect movie reviews from twitter, weeks before and after the release of movies and calculate the sentiment score for each movie. We analyze various variables from Twitter such as, retweet counts, followers count, and other variables related to a movie such as, budget, box office collection, actor rating, director rating etc. We try to identify the correlation among various variables. Also, we try to predict the retweet count using three different data mining techniques-decision tree(CHAID), k means clustering and neural net.
